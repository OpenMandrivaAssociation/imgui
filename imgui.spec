%description
ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs
optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline
enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and
self-contained (no external dependencies).

ImGui is designed to enable fast iteration and empower programmers to create
content creation tools and visualization/ debug tools (as opposed to UI for the
average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and
thus lacks certain features normally found in more high-level libraries.

ImGui is particularly suited to integration in realtime 3D applications,
fullscreen applications, embedded applications, games, or any applications on
consoles platforms where operating system features are non-standard.

%description -n %{devname}
ImGui is self-contained within a few files that you can easily copy and compile
into your application/engine.

No specific build process is required. You can add the .cpp files to your
project or #include them from an existing file.
